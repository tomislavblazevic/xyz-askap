This code is about the sonification of a distant phenomenon in space, which is broadcasting a signal in both usual and X-ray spectra (askap_j1832) for the first time in history.
How to do it:

Find the file:
The script saves the audio as askap_j1832_simulacija.wav in the same folder as your script (xyz-askap).

Play the file:

Double-click the .wav file in Windows Explorer to open it with your default audio player (e.g., Windows Media Player, VLC).
Or, right-click and choose your preferred player.
If you hear the sequence of tones (impulses), your script worked correctly!
